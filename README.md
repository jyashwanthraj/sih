Problem Statement Title	: Air and water quality index and environment monitoring

Description	:

Considering the importance of air and water to human existence, air pollution and water pollution are critical issues that require collective effort for prevention and control. Different types of anthropogenic activities have resulted in environmental dilapidation and ruin. One of the tools that can be used for such a campaign is Air Quality Index (AQI). The AQI was based on the concentrations of different pollutants: We are also familiar with the Water Quality Index (WQI), which in simple terms tells what the quality of drinking water is from a drinking water supply. There is a need for constant and continuous environment monitoring of air quality and water quality for the development of AQI and WQI, which in turn will enable clear communication of how clean or unhealthy the air and water in the study area is.

Protecting the atmospheric environment involves  control of atmospheric emissions as well as an understanding of pollutant dispersion, monitoring emission levels, i.e. concentration in ambient air.


To monitor these levels there are Air Quality Monitoring API’s The main objective of these Networks is to record the concentration levels of atmospheric pollutants in order to define air quality levels and establish action plans if high levels of contamination are detected. 

Other objectives are: 
• Locating contamination problem areas and understanding their changes to be done.
• Complying with atmospheric air protection legislation 
• Obtaining the necessary information to define Action   Plans as stipulated by Indian directives or other international regulations if alert thresholds are breached. 
• Informing citizens regarding local air quality status. 


A weather API is an Application Programming Interface that allows weather data to be queried from scripts and code. Good weather APIs provide both historical weather data and forecast data via an easy-to-use, well-defined programming interface.
