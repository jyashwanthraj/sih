1.0 INTRODUCTION

Protecting the atmospheric environment involves  control of atmospheric emissions as well as an understanding of pollutant dispersion, monitoring emission levels, i.e. concentration in ambient air.


To monitor these levels there are Air Quality Monitoring API’s The main objective of these Networks is to record the concentration levels of atmospheric pollutants in order to define air quality levels and establish action plans if high levels of contamination are detected. 

Other objectives are: 
• Locating contamination problem areas and understanding their changes to be done.
• Complying with atmospheric air protection legislation 
• Obtaining the necessary information to define Action   Plans as stipulated by Indian directives or other international regulations if alert thresholds are breached. 
• Informing citizens regarding local air quality status. 


A weather API is an Application Programming Interface that allows weather data to be queried from scripts and code. Good weather APIs provide both historical weather data and forecast data via an easy-to-use, well-defined programming interface.
